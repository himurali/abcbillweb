## Vision and People:


The vision for London's cycling culture is one of sustainability, accessibility, and safety. The goal is to create a city where cycling is a viable and attractive mode of transportation for all residents, regardless of age, ability, or income. Behind this vision are the many people who have worked tirelessly to promote cycling in London, from dedicated cyclists and community groups to government officials and advocacy organizations. By working together, these individuals and groups have helped to transform London into a cycling city that is recognized around the world for its commitment to sustainable transportation.

Investment in cycling infrastructure - Johnson oversaw a significant investment in cycling infrastructure during his time in office, with millions of pounds spent on initiatives like the Cycle Superhighways and the Mini-Holland schemes.

Promotion of cycling as a mode of transportation - Johnson worked to promote cycling as a viable and attractive mode of transportation, launching campaigns like the "Boris Bike" Cycle Hire scheme and his Vision for Cycling.

Advocacy for cycling safety - Johnson was a vocal advocate for cycling safety, introducing measures like HGV safety standards and working to improve conditions for cyclists at busy junctions.

Overall, Johnson's contributions helped to transform London into one of the world's leading cycling cities, and his legacy can still be seen in the city's thriving cycling culture today.


## History:
London's cycling culture dates back to the early 20th century, with the formation of cycling clubs and the introduction of cycling infrastructure. However, it wasn't until the 1970s that London began to implement dedicated bike lanes and cycling routes. These efforts continued into the 1990s and 2000s, with the introduction of the first Cycle Superhighway in 2010.
