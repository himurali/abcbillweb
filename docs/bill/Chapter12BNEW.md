# Chapter 12: Outcomes

- Improved public health: By prioritizing active mobility, India could improve public
health outcomes and reduce the burden of chronic diseases.
- Reduced air pollution: By promoting active mobility and reducing the use of
motor vehicles, India could significantly reduce air pollution levels and improve air
quality.
- Increased economic productivity: Active mobility can increase economic
productivity by reducing traffic congestion, improving the efficiency of the
transportation system, and reducing transportation costs for individuals and
businesses.
- Improved urban planning: Prioritizing active mobility can lead to better urban
planning and design, including the development of more pedestrian-friendly
streets, dedicated cycling infrastructure, and improved public transportation
systems.
- Reduced carbon footprint: Transportation is a significant contributor to
greenhouse gas emissions, and prioritizing active mobility can significantly reduce
India's carbon footprint.
- Enhanced social inclusion: Prioritizing active mobility can improve social inclusion
by providing more accessible and affordable transportation options for lowincome
communities and marginalized groups.
- Improved quality of life: Prioritizing active mobility can improve the quality of life
for citizens by reducing traffic congestion, improving air quality, promoting
physical activity, and enhancing social connections and community engagement.

In conclusion, the Active Mobility Bill in India can have several positive outcomes on health, fossil fuel import bill, transport cost, environment conservation, and time saved by reducing congestion. However, the success of the bill depends on effective implementation and the cooperation of all stakeholders, including the government, private sector, and the public.
