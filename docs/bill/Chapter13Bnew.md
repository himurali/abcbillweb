# Chapter 13: Way Forward


The proposed ABC Bill and its implementation require a multi-faceted approach that includes research on the actual impact of the proposed policies, delivery standards and processes, organization design, and funding. Here are some suggestions for a way forward:

**Research on the actual impact:** It is essential to conduct research on the impact of the proposed ABC Bill. This research should focus on the potential reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, the health benefits associated with active mobility, and the economic benefits of promoting active mobility.

**Research on the process of delivery standards and processes:** Research should also be conducted on the delivery standards and processes required for the effective implementation of the ABC Bill. This research should focus on identifying best practices and strategies for delivering the infrastructure required for active mobility, including walking and cycling paths, bike-sharing programs, and public transport services.

**Research on the organization design:** Research should also be conducted on the organization design required for the effective implementation of the ABC Bill. This research should focus on identifying the organizational structures and processes required for effective policy implementation, including the establishment of a dedicated Active Mobility Board to oversee the implementation of the policies.

**Research on funding:** It is essential to conduct research on funding mechanisms required to finance the infrastructure required for active mobility. This research should focus on identifying potential sources of funding, including global funding and other global collaborations, public-private partnerships, and innovative financing mechanisms.

**Appointment of the ABC Bill board:** The ABC Bill Board should be appointed from various leadership across India to promote active mobility. The board should be tasked with overseeing the implementation of the ABC Bill and ensuring that the policies are effectively delivered.

In conclusion, a comprehensive approach is required to ensure the effective implementation of the proposed ABC Bill. This approach should include research on the actual impact of the policies, delivery standards and processes, organization design, funding, and the appointment of a dedicated Active Mobility Board.
