# Chapter 2 Context 
Short title and commencement:
(a) This bill may be called the Atmanirbhar Bharath Cycle Bill, 2023.
(b) It shall come into force on the date of its publication in the Official Gazette.

Definitions:
(a) "Active mobility" means non-motorized modes of transportation, including cycling and walking.
(b) "Commissionerate for Active Mobility" means the office of the government responsible for the implementation of this bill.
(c) "Mission for Building the Movement" means the initiative launched under this bill to promote active mobility in India.

## Motivation 

The Atmanirbhar Bharat Cycle Bill is motivated by the need to address the numerous issues associated with car-centered mobility in India. The current transportation system in India heavily relies on cars, which has led to several problems such as air pollution, traffic congestion, and road accidents. These issues not only have a negative impact on public health and the environment but also contribute to economic inefficiencies.

One of the main motivations for this bill is to promote active mobility and reduce the reliance on cars as the primary mode of transportation. Cycling and other forms of active mobility not only provide a sustainable and environmentally friendly alternative to cars but also have several health benefits. By promoting cycling, this bill seeks to reduce air pollution, traffic congestion, and road accidents, and promote public health.

Another motivation for this bill is to promote self-reliance or "Atmanirbhar Bharat" in the transportation sector. By promoting cycling and other forms of active mobility, this bill seeks to reduce India's dependence on imported oil and promote local manufacturing of bicycles and related infrastructure. This will not only contribute to India's economic growth but also promote self-sufficiency in the transportation sector.

Additionally, this bill is motivated by the need to promote equity and justice in transportation. The current transportation system in India disproportionately affects marginalized communities such as low-income and disabled populations. By promoting cycling and other forms of active mobility, this bill seeks to provide equitable access to transportation and reduce the social and economic disparities caused by car-centered mobility.

Overall, the Atmanirbhar Bharat Cycle Bill is motivated by the need to promote a sustainable, self-reliant, and equitable transportation system that benefits all members of society.








## 2.1 Paradign Shift in Mobility


### Car-centered to cycle-centered mobility: 
The current paradigm in Bharath is centered around car ownership and usage. The shift to cycle-centered mobility would involve a change in the mindset and infrastructure to prioritize cycling as a preferred mode of transport. This would require investments in cycle lanes, parking facilities, and cycle-friendly streets, as well as education campaigns to raise awareness about the benefits of cycling.

### From man driving car to kids riding cycle:  
The shift to kids riding cycles would involve a change in behavior, with parents and caregivers prioritizing cycling as a safe and healthy mode of transport for their children. This would require investments in safe cycle routes and education campaigns to promote cycling as a healthy and safe activity for children.

### From women lacking access to women moving freely: 
 Indian women face many barriers to mobility, including lack of access to safe and affordable transport. The shift to women moving freely would involve investments in safe and accessible cycle routes, as well as education campaigns to promote cycling as a safe and healthy mode of transport for women. This would allow women to move more freely and independently, improving their quality of life and promoting gender equality.

### From elders locked in home to spending in green spaces:
  Many elders are isolated and lack opportunities for social interaction and physical activity. The shift to spending time in green spaces would involve investments in cycle-friendly green spaces, such as parks and nature reserves, as well as education campaigns to promote cycling as a healthy and safe activity for older people. This would encourage elders to spend more time outdoors, promoting social interaction and physical activity, and improving their overall health and wellbeing.

## Antyodaya

An "Antyodaya" approach to mobility in India refers to the principle of ensuring that the most marginalized and vulnerable segments of society have access to safe, reliable, and affordable transportation options. This is particularly important in a country like India, where a large proportion of the population lives in poverty and lacks access to basic services and infrastructure.

Active mobility, which includes walking and cycling, can play a critical role in providing transportation options for the poorest segments of society. Unlike motorized transport, walking and cycling require minimal infrastructure and can be easily accessed by people of all income levels. Additionally, active mobility can provide health benefits by promoting physical activity and reducing air pollution.

To promote an "Antyodaya" approach to mobility in India, policymakers must prioritize investments in infrastructure and services that benefit the poorest segments of society. This includes building safe and accessible footpaths and cycle lanes in low-income neighborhoods, as well as improving public transport services in areas where there are few alternatives to walking or cycling.

In addition to physical infrastructure, policymakers must also address the social and economic barriers that prevent the poorest segments of society from accessing transportation options. This may include providing financial support for low-income households to purchase bicycles or access public transport, as well as addressing gender-based discrimination that may prevent women from using active mobility options.

In sum, promoting an "Antyodaya" approach to mobility in India through active mobility can help ensure that the most vulnerable segments of society have access to safe, reliable, and affordable transportation options. By prioritizing investments in infrastructure and services that benefit the poorest segments of society, policymakers can help build a more equitable, healthy, and sustainable society for all.

## Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas - Inclusive active mobility  for India -

Sabka Sath, Sabka Vikas" is a motto that has been embraced by the Government of India to reflect its commitment to inclusive development. At the heart of this commitment is the recognition that every citizen, regardless of their background or circumstances, should have equal access to the opportunities and benefits of economic growth and development.

In the context of transportation, this commitment translates into a vision of inclusive active mobility that prioritizes investments in infrastructure and services that benefit all citizens, regardless of their mode of transport or income level. This includes building safe and accessible footpaths and cycle lanes, improving public transport systems, and promoting walking and cycling as viable modes of transportation.

Inclusive active mobility can have a range of benefits for society as a whole. It can improve public health by reducing air pollution and promoting physical activity. It can also enhance social inclusion by making transportation more affordable and accessible to low-income households, as well as persons with disabilities, women, and other marginalized groups.

To achieve this vision of inclusive active mobility, policymakers must prioritize investments in infrastructure and services that benefit all citizens, particularly those who are currently underserved or excluded from the transportation system. This requires a comprehensive approach that involves collaboration between government agencies, civil society organizations, and the private sector, as well as robust data collection and analysis to ensure that policies are evidence-based and effective.

In sum, "Sabka Sath, Sabka Vikas" provides a powerful framework for promoting inclusive active mobility in India. By investing in infrastructure and services that benefit all citizens, policymakers can help build a more equitable, healthy, and sustainable society for all.

## "Atmanirbhar mobility"

In summary, promoting Atmanirbhar mobility through active mobility can help India build a more resilient, sustainable, and equitable transportation system. By prioritizing domestic innovation and production in active mobility equipment and technology, as well as addressing social and economic barriers to transportation access, policymakers can help create a more self-reliant and sovereign transportation system for all Indians.

"Atmanirbhar mobility" or self-reliant mobility is an important goal for India as it seeks to build a more resilient and sustainable transportation system. This approach emphasizes the need for India to become less dependent on imports of vehicles and technology, and instead develop its own domestic capabilities to meet the country's mobility needs.

## Energy Transition 

India, like many other countries, is facing the urgent need to transition away from fossil fuels in order to mitigate the impacts of climate change and reduce air pollution. Active mobility, particularly cycling, can play a crucial role in this energy transition by providing a low-carbon and sustainable mode of transportation.

According to estimates, if India were to increase cycling by just 10% by 2050, it could potentially reduce carbon emissions by 46.5 million tons per year. This is equivalent to the emissions of over 10 million passenger vehicles driven for one year or the emissions from 5 coal-fired power plants.

Furthermore, if India were to increase cycling by just 3% per year, it could potentially save the country up to $1.5 billion in fuel imports by 2030.

In addition to reducing carbon emissions and saving on fuel costs, increasing cycling can also have significant health benefits for individuals and society as a whole. Regular cycling can improve cardiovascular health, reduce the risk of chronic diseases, and help reduce healthcare costs.

To achieve this transition to active mobility, policymakers must prioritize investments in cycling infrastructure, including safe and accessible bike lanes, parking facilities, and traffic calming measures. Additionally, policymakers must address social and economic barriers to cycling, such as promoting gender equity and providing financial incentives for low-income households to purchase bicycles.

In sum, the transition to active mobility, particularly cycling, is a critical component of India's efforts to reduce carbon emissions and achieve a more sustainable and equitable transportation system. By increasing cycling by even a small percentage, India can make significant strides towards meeting its climate goals and improving public health.
