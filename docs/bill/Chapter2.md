# Chapter 2 Context , Motivation & Transformation Paradigm's
Short title and commencement:
- (a) This bill may be called the Atmanirbhar Bharath Cycle Bill, 2023.
- (b) It shall come into force on the date of its publication in the Official Gazette.

Definitions:
- (a) "Active mobility" means non-motorized modes of transportation, including cycling and walking.
- (b) "Commissionerate for Active Mobility" means the office of the government responsible for the implementation of this bill.
- (c) "Mission for Building the Movement" means the initiative launched under this bill to promote active mobility in India.

## Motivation 

The Atmanirbhar Bharat Cycle Bill is motivated by the need to address the numerous issues associated with car-centered mobility in India. The current transportation system in India heavily relies on cars, which has led to several problems such as air pollution, traffic congestion, and road accidents. These issues not only have a negative impact on public health and the environment but also contribute to economic inefficiencies.

One of the main motivations for this bill is to promote active mobility and reduce the reliance on cars as the primary mode of transportation. Cycling and other forms of active mobility not only provide a sustainable and environmentally friendly alternative to cars but also have several health benefits. By promoting cycling, this bill seeks to reduce air pollution, traffic congestion, and road accidents, and promote public health.

Another motivation for this bill is to promote self-reliance or "Atmanirbhar Bharat" in the transportation sector. By promoting cycling and other forms of active mobility, this bill seeks to reduce India's dependence on imported oil and promote local manufacturing of bicycles and related infrastructure. This will not only contribute to India's economic growth but also promote self-sufficiency in the transportation sector.

Additionally, this bill is motivated by the need to promote equity and justice in transportation. The current transportation system in India disproportionately affects marginalized communities such as low-income and disabled populations. By promoting cycling and other forms of active mobility, this bill seeks to provide equitable access to transportation and reduce the social and economic disparities caused by car-centered mobility.

Overall, the Atmanirbhar Bharat Cycle Bill is motivated by the need to promote a sustainable, self-reliant, and equitable transportation system that benefits all members of society. 


##  Paradign Shift in Mobility


### Car-centered to cycle-centered mobility: 
The current paradigm in Bharath is centered around car ownership and usage. The shift to cycle-centered mobility would involve a change in the mindset and infrastructure to prioritize cycling as a preferred mode of transport. This would require investments in cycle lanes, parking facilities, and cycle-friendly streets, as well as education campaigns to raise awareness about the benefits of cycling.

### From man driving car to kids riding cycle:  
The shift to kids riding cycles would involve a change in behavior, with parents and caregivers prioritizing cycling as a safe and healthy mode of transport for their children. This would require investments in safe cycle routes and education campaigns to promote cycling as a healthy and safe activity for children.

### From women lacking access to women moving freely: 
 Indian women face many barriers to mobility, including lack of access to safe and affordable transport. The shift to women moving freely would involve investments in safe and accessible cycle routes, as well as education campaigns to promote cycling as a safe and healthy mode of transport for women. This would allow women to move more freely and independently, improving their quality of life and promoting gender equality.

### From elders locked in home to spending in green spaces:
  Many elders are isolated and lack opportunities for social interaction and physical activity. The shift to spending time in green spaces would involve investments in cycle-friendly green spaces, such as parks and nature reserves, as well as education campaigns to promote cycling as a healthy and safe activity for older people. This would encourage elders to spend more time outdoors, promoting social interaction and physical activity, and improving their overall health and wellbeing.



##   Paradigm Shift in Road Safety 

| Parameters  |  Traditional | ABC Bill Proposed Safe System  |
|---|---|---|
| Accidents | Prevent crashes by putting road humps etc | Prevent deaths and serious injuries by building safe systems |
| Human Behavior | Improve human behavior | Design for human mistakes/limitations |
| Road Speed |  Control speeding | Reduce system kinetic energy |
| Responsibility on Road Designers | Nil - Individuals are responsible  | Share responsibility |
| Accountability  on Road Designers| Nil - React based on crash  history |   Proactively identify and address risks |
