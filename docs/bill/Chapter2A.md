# Chapter 2A  Cycling - Impact Failure
 

## Cycling - Impact Failure

The cycling initiatives taken in various cities were unable to scale -  due to the lack of initiative, stakeholder engagement, political commitment, public confidence, clarity of objectives, strength of evidence, and organization to manage, measure and align. Let's discuss each of these headings in detail.

### Lack of Initiative: 
The lack of initiative from the government and other stakeholders in promoting cycling as a mode of transportation has been a major setback for cycling in India. The focus has been largely on motorized transportation, with little emphasis on developing cycling infrastructure or promoting cycling as a viable mode of transportation.

### Stakeholder Engagement: 
The lack of stakeholder engagement has also been a major issue in the development of cycling in India. The development of cycling infrastructure requires the involvement of multiple stakeholders, including government agencies, NGOs, cycling groups, and the private sector. The lack of engagement and coordination among these stakeholders has resulted in fragmented and uncoordinated efforts to promote cycling.

### Political Commitment: 
The lack of political commitment to cycling has been another major obstacle to the development of cycling in India. While some states and cities have taken steps to promote cycling, there has been a lack of sustained political commitment to make cycling a priority in urban transportation planning.

###  Public Confidence:
 The lack of public confidence in cycling as a safe and viable mode of transportation has also been a major barrier to the development of cycling in India. This is due to a lack of safe and well-designed cycling infrastructure, as well as a lack of awareness and education about cycling safety and the benefits of cycling.

### Clarity of Objectives: 
The lack of clarity of objectives in promoting cycling has also been a hindrance to its development in India. The lack of clear objectives and targets for promoting cycling has made it difficult to measure progress and evaluate the impact of cycling initiatives.

### Strength of Evidence by demonstrating success in Active Mobility Projects:
 The lack of strong evidence to support the benefits of cycling has also been a challenge in promoting cycling in India. There is a need for more research and data on the economic, environmental, and health benefits of cycling to build the case for investment in cycling infrastructure and promotion.

### Organization to Manage, Measure and Align: 
Finally, the lack of organization to manage, measure, and align cycling initiatives has also been a major hurdle to the development of cycling in India. There is a need for a dedicated organization to oversee the development and implementation of cycling infrastructure and promotion, as well as to measure progress and align efforts among stakeholders.

In summary, the lack of initiative, stakeholder engagement, political commitment, public confidence, clarity of objectives, strength of evidence, and organization to manage, measure, and align has resulted in a lost decade of cycling in India. Addressing these issues will be crucial to promoting cycling as a viable and sustainable mode of transportation in the country.


The lack of strength of evidence to support the benefits of active mobility projects, including cycling infrastructure, has been a significant obstacle to promoting active mobility in India. The absence of credible data and research on the economic, social, and health benefits of cycling infrastructure has made it challenging to make the case for investment in such projects. This has resulted in many cycling projects in India being unsuccessful.

However, there have been some successful active mobility projects in India that have demonstrated the potential of such initiatives to transform urban transportation. For example, the Smart City Mission, a flagship initiative of the Indian government, has funded several cycling and pedestrian projects in select cities. Some of these projects have seen significant success, such as the cycle sharing system in Bhopal, which has more than 6,000 cycles and 250 stations, and has been used by more than 1.5 million people since its launch in 2017.

Similarly, the Raahgiri initiative, which started in Gurugram in 2013 and has now spread to several other cities, has created car-free zones on Sundays to promote cycling and walking. The initiative has been highly successful, with thousands of people participating each week, and has been credited with promoting cycling and walking as alternative modes of transportation.

Furthermore, many cities in India are now adopting the "complete streets" approach, which prioritizes pedestrians, cyclists, and public transport users over private vehicles. For example, the city of Chennai has developed a comprehensive non-motorized transport policy that focuses on improving walking and cycling infrastructure.

In conclusion, while many cycling projects in India have failed due to the lack of strength of evidence, there are also examples of successful active mobility projects that have demonstrated the potential of such initiatives to transform urban transportation. It is crucial to gather more data and research on the benefits of active mobility and promote successful projects to build public support and make the case for investment in such initiatives.
