# Chapter 3 Atmanirbhar Bharat Cycle Mission
 

A MISSION to promote and implement active mobility in India on a mission mode with a focus on last mile connectivity, integration with public transport, and bicycle tourism, with a methodology for implementation and measurement of progress with feedback from citizens.

## BACKGROUND
Active mobility, which includes walking, cycling, and other non-motorized modes of transportation, is essential for sustainable and efficient urban transportation. It has the potential to reduce traffic congestion, air pollution, carbon emissions, and promote healthy lifestyles. However, the lack of proper infrastructure, safety concerns, and limited last-mile connectivity have hindered its growth in India.

To address these issues, the Government of India is launching Mission Atmanirbhar Bharat Cycle, aimed at promoting and implementing active mobility on a mission mode with a focus on last mile connectivity, integration with public transport, and bicycle tourism.

## COMPONENTS OF THE MISSION
The Mission Atmanirbhar Bharat Cycle will focus on the following components:

(a) Last mile connectivity - Providing infrastructure and facilities for cycling and walking as a last-mile solution for public transport connectivity.

(b) Integration with public transport - Promoting seamless integration of cycling and walking with public transport to increase the usage of active mobility.

(c) Bicycle tourism - Developing cycling routes and facilities to promote bicycle tourism and attract tourists to different parts of the country.

## METHODOLOGY FOR IMPLEMENTATION
The Mission Atmanirbhar Bharat Cycle will be implemented through the following methodology:

- (a) Identification of target cities - The mission will initially focus on 100 cities across India, with the potential to expand to more cities in the future.
- (b) Preparation of a comprehensive plan - A comprehensive plan will be prepared for each target city, which will include infrastructure development, policy and regulatory measures, and public awareness campaigns.
- (c) Allocation of funding - The central government will provide funding for the implementation of the mission, which will be supplemented by funding from state governments, international agencies, and private sector entities.
- (d) Implementation of infrastructure development - Infrastructure development will include the creation of cycling lanes, pedestrian walkways, bicycle parking facilities, and other relevant facilities.
- (e) Implementation of policy and regulatory measures - Policy and regulatory measures will be implemented to promote the use of active mobility, including incentives for cycling and walking, and penalties for non-compliance.
- (f) Public awareness campaigns - Public awareness campaigns will be launched to promote the benefits of active mobility and encourage citizens to adopt it.
 

## MEASUREMENT OF PROGRESS AND CITIZEN FEEDBACK
The progress of the Mission Atmanirbhar Bharat Cycle will be measured through the following indicators:

(a) Number of cycling and walking trips per day.

(b) Reduction in traffic congestion, air pollution, and carbon emissions.

(c) Increase in the number of people using active mobility for commuting.

(d) Increase in the number of cycling and walking tourists.

Citizen feedback will be collected through online surveys, public meetings, and other relevant mechanisms to ensure that the mission is aligned with the needs and aspirations of citizens.

## CONCLUSION
The Mission Atmanirbhar Bharat Cycle will promote active mobility and create a sustainable and efficient urban transportation system in India. It will provide last-mile connectivity, integrate with public transport, and promote bicycle tourism. The mission will be implemented through a comprehensive plan and methodology, with measurement of progress and feedback from citizens.
