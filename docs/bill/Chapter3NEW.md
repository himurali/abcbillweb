As part of the Bharath Cycle Bill, there is a strong focus on reducing  traffic violence. Promoting cycling as a safe and sustainable mode of transportation will lead to reduced traffic violence. The Bharath Cycle Bill recognizes the benefits of cycling in promoting awareness and mindfulness. Cycling promotes a sense of community and encourages empathy towards other cyclists and pedestrians on the road. Cyclists are often seen supporting and encouraging one another, which fosters a sense of togetherness and kindness.
The Bill emphasizes the multiple dimensions of the bill and the line of thought being in line with the many initiatives of the Government of India listed below.

## Swachh Bharat Abhiyan

By promoting clean mobility and keeping the environment clean, "Swachh Bharat Abhiyan" Approach aims to improve public health and reduce the burden of diseases .

## Antyodaya

An "Antyodaya" approach to mobility in India means ensuring that marginalized segments have access to safe, affordable transport. Active mobility, such as walking and cycling, can provide benefits and should be prioritized as they require minimal infrastructure and offer health benefits. Policymakers need to invest in physical infrastructure and address social and economic barriers to access, such as providing financial support for low-income households to purchase bicycles, and tackling gender-based discrimination that may prevent women from using active mobility options. Overall, promoting an "Antyodaya" approach to mobility through active mobility can build a more equitable, healthy, and sustainable society for all.

## Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas - Inclusive active mobility  for India -
"Sabka Sath, Sabka Vikas" is the motto of the Indian Government for inclusive development, ensuring equal access to opportunities and benefits for all citizens. In the context of transportation, this translates to inclusive active mobility through investments in infrastructure and services that benefit all citizens. This includes improving public transport, building safe and accessible footpaths and cycle lanes, and promoting walking and cycling. Such mobility can have social, economic, and health benefits for all citizens, including marginalized groups. To achieve this, policymakers need to collaborate and collect evidence-based data to ensure effective policies that promote inclusive active mobility and build a more equitable, healthy, and sustainable society.

In sum, "Sabka Sath, Sabka Vikas" provides a powerful framework for promoting inclusive active mobility in India. By investing in infrastructure and services that benefit all citizens, policymakers can help build a more equitable, healthy, and sustainable society for all.

## "Atmanirbhar mobility" - Make India the Manufacturing Hub of High Quality Cycles.


 Promoting Atmanirbhar mobility through active mobility can help India build a more resilient, sustainable, and equitable transportation system. By prioritizing domestic innovation and production in active mobility equipment and technology, as well as addressing social and economic barriers to transportation access, policymakers can help create a more self-reliant and sovereign transportation system for all Indians.
 Promote indigenous high quality bicycle manufacturing, reduce dependence on imports, and boost the country's economy. 

"Atmanirbhar mobility" or self-reliant mobility is an important goal for India as it seeks to build a more resilient and sustainable transportation system. This approach emphasizes the need for India to become less dependent on imports of vehicles and technology, and instead develop its own domestic capabilities to meet the country's mobility needs.

### Energy Transition 

India, like many other countries, is facing the urgent need to transition away from fossil fuels in order to mitigate the impacts of climate change and reduce air pollution. Active mobility, particularly cycling, can play a crucial role in this energy transition by providing a low-carbon and sustainable mode of transportation.

According to estimates, if India were to increase cycling by just 10% by 2050, it could potentially reduce carbon emissions by 46.5 million tons per year. This is equivalent to the emissions of over 10 million passenger vehicles driven for one year or the emissions from 5 coal-fired power plants.

Furthermore, if India were to increase cycling by just 3% per year, it could potentially save the country up to $1.5 billion in fuel imports by 2030.

In addition to reducing carbon emissions and saving on fuel costs, increasing cycling can also have significant health benefits for individuals and society as a whole. Regular cycling can improve cardiovascular health, reduce the risk of chronic diseases, and help reduce healthcare costs.

To achieve this transition to active mobility, policymakers must prioritize investments in cycling infrastructure, including safe and accessible bike lanes, parking facilities, and traffic calming measures. Additionally, policymakers must address social and economic barriers to cycling, such as promoting gender equity and providing financial incentives for low-income households to purchase bicycles.

In sum, the transition to active mobility, particularly cycling, is a critical component of India's efforts to reduce carbon emissions and achieve a more sustainable and equitable transportation system. By increasing cycling by even a small percentage, India can make significant strides towards meeting its climate goals and improving public health.

### Spiritual Dimensions of the ABC Bill

#### Vedic Foundations "Namaste Vayo Tvamekam Brahmasmi"
The Bharath Bicycle Bill recognizes the ancient teachings of the Vedas, which have been a guiding force for Indian society for thousands of years. One of the key teachings of the Vedas is the proclamation "Namaste Vayo Tvamekam Brahmasmi," which means "I bow to the air, the greater life force that pervades everywhere, I am one with Brahman."

This statement recognizes the vital role that air or 'Vayu' plays in sustaining all life on earth. It also acknowledges that air or 'Vayu' is a powerful force that pervades everything, including our bodies and minds. By recognizing this, we can develop a deeper understanding of our interconnectedness with the natural world and our responsibility to protect and preserve it.

#### Jainism and Reduction of Traffic Violence

Jainism, an ancient Indian religion, emphasizes the principles of non-violence (ahimsa), compassion, and respect for all living beings. These principles can be applied to promote walking and cycling as sustainable and non-violent modes of transportation, and to reduce traffic violence.

One of the key Jain mantras is "Ahimsa Paramo Dharma," which means non-violence is the highest duty. This principle can be applied to promote non-violent modes of transportation, such as walking and cycling, and to discourage the use of cars and other vehicles that contribute to traffic violence.

Jainism also emphasizes the importance of simplicity and reducing one's impact on the environment. Walking and cycling are simple and sustainable modes of transportation that can help reduce air pollution and carbon emissions, which contribute to climate change.

Another Jain mantra is "Parasparopagraho Jivanam," which means all living beings are interdependent and have a duty to help one another. This principle can be applied to promote active mobility by encouraging individuals to walk or cycle instead of driving, reducing traffic congestion and improving air quality, which benefits all living beings.

Jainism also emphasizes the importance of mindfulness and being present in the moment. Walking and cycling can be meditative practices that promote mindfulness, reduce stress, and improve mental health.

In conclusion, the principles of Jainism, including non-violence, simplicity, interdependence, and mindfulness, can be applied to promote walking and cycling as sustainable and non-violent modes of transportation, and to reduce traffic violence. By incorporating Jain thoughts and mantras into our daily lives, we can promote a more peaceful, sustainable, and compassionate world.


#### Buddhism  and Active Mobility 

One of the key Buddhist principles is the concept of the Middle Way, which emphasizes balance and moderation. This principle can be applied to promote active mobility by encouraging individuals to walk or cycle instead of driving excessively, reducing traffic congestion and improving air quality.
Buddhism also emphasizes the importance of non-violence and harmlessness towards all living beings. Walking and cycling are non-violent modes of transportation that can help reduce the number of accidents and injuries caused by car accidents.

Buddhism also emphasizes the importance of mindfulness and being present in the moment. Walking and cycling can be meditative practices that promote mindfulness, reduce stress, and improve mental health.

Traffic can be a stressful and frustrating experience, especially in urban areas with high congestion and long commute times. However, incorporating mindfulness practices into our daily commute can help reduce stress and promote a more positive and peaceful experience.

ABC Bill encourages a shift towards a mindfull mobility and a responsible behavior by the citizens of the earth.

Lokah Samastah Sukhino Bhavantu - This mantra translates to "May all beings everywhere be happy and free, and may the thoughts, words, and actions of my own life contribute in some way to that happiness and to that freedom for all." It is a reminder to cultivate compassion and kindness towards all living beings.
ABC Bill emphasizes how we can create  a more peaceful, sustainable, and compassionate world.
