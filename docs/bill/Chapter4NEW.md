# Chapter 4 Active Mobility Economy & International Goals

## Active Mobility Economy

The size of the Active Mobility Economy can be estimated by looking at the various sectors that contribute to it. Here's a breakdown of some of the key sectors:

- Bicycle sharing: The bicycle sharing market is estimated to be worth around $5.5 billion globally. In India, the bicycle sharing market is still relatively small, but is growing rapidly. According to a report by Deloitte, the Indian bicycle sharing market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 30% between 2020 and 2025.
- Bicycle tourism: The bicycle tourism industry is also growing, with an estimated global market size of around $47 billion. In India, bicycle tourism is still in its early stages, but there is potential for growth in this sector as more people seek out sustainable and active travel options.
- Bicycle sports: The bicycle sports industry includes events such as cycling races, triathlons, and other competitive events. The global market size for bicycle sports is estimated to be around $56 billion. In India, there is a growing interest in competitive cycling, with more events being organized and more athletes participating.
- Bicycle industry: The bicycle industry is a large and diverse sector, encompassing everything from manufacturing and sales to maintenance and repair. The global market size for bicycles and related products is estimated to be around $50 billion. In India, the bicycle industry needs to be global and competetive, but there is potential for growth as more people adopt active mobility options.


| Category         | Global Size (USD)     |    Potential Indian Market Size (USD)  -estimated as percentage of global market  |%ge of global market|
|------------------|----------------|--------|--|
| Bicycle Sharing  | 5.6 billion    |    1 billion    | 20%|
| Bicycle Tourism  | 47 billion |       10 billion     | 10%|
| Bicycle Sports   | 53.4 billion   |     5 billion   | 10%|
| Bicycle Industry | 57 billion     |    20 billion    | 20%|
| Active Mobility Urban Planning & Services | 20 billion     |    2 billion    | 10%|
| Electric Bikes   | 50 billion     |    10 billion    |  20%|
| Total             | 222 billion   |     48 billion   |  |

The ABC Bill estimates that the Economy is around $50 Billion and aims to capture this critical market by positioning India's talent and engineering capability to capture the global active economy market.

##  Sustainable Development Goals - Enabled by the ABC Bill  
The United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are a set of 17 goals aimed at achieving a sustainable future for all. ABC Bill aims to support several SDG goals that relate to walking and cycling, including:

- **Goal 3:** Good Health and Well-being - Promoting walking and cycling as modes of transportation can lead to improved physical and mental health, as well as reduced air pollution and traffic congestion.
- **Goal 4:** Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong
learning opportunities for all.
    Access to schools is a major global challenge, e. A safe route to school will not only
provide physical access to education, but also will encourage students to continue their education.
- **Goal 5:** Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls. 
Women are often at a greater disadvantage when it comes to transport than men. This is mainly due to the fact that women tend to take shorter, more varied, and more frequent trips than men. This means that public transportation systems often fail to meet their needs. As a result, women are forced to rely on other means of transportation such as private vehicles or taxis which can be more expensive and time-consuming. Furthermore, women may also have limited access to information about public transportation options which can further exacerbate the problem. Making active mobility options more available and safer for women will contribute to gender equality by creating infrastructure that protects women walkers.  

- **Goal 11:** Sustainable Cities and Communities - Encouraging active transportation modes like walking and cycling can help create more livable and sustainable cities by reducing the reliance on cars and promoting more compact and connected urban areas.

- **Goal 13:** Climate Action - Walking and cycling are low-carbon modes of transportation, which can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate the effects of climate change.

- **Goal 16:** Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions - Promoting walking and cycling as safe and accessible modes of transportation can help create more equitable and inclusive societies by providing affordable and sustainable transportation options for all.

Overall, promoting walking and cycling can help achieve several of the SDGs and create a more sustainable and equitable future for all.


## GLobal Health Agenda

WHO Report on Physical Inactivity Mentions the following 
- The most recent available global comparative estimates from 2010 indicate that worldwide,
23% of adults and 81% of adolescents (aged 11–17 years) do not meet the WHO global
recommendations on physical activity for health1 (6). 
- Notably, the prevalence of inactivity varies considerably within and between countries, and can be as high as 80% in some adult subpopulations.
- Globally, physical inactivity is estimated to cost  INT$ 54 billion in direct health care, in 2013, of which 57% is incurred by the public sector  and an additional INT$ 14 billion is attributable to lost productivity (17).
-  Estimates from both  high-income, as well as low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) indicate that between 1–3% of national health care expenditures are
attributable to physical inactivity 

Given the increasingly urbanized world, with more than 70% of the global population
living in urban centres, cities have a particular  responsibility and opportunity to contribute to
this agenda through improving urban design and sustainable transport systems.

ABC Bill embraces the Global Action Plan on PHYSICAL ACTIVITY 2030 and supports the vision of "More active people for a healthier world".
ABC Bill incorporates the following strategic objectives mentioned by the WHO 

- 1. Create active societies
- 2. Create active environments
- 3. Create active people
- 4. Create active systems

## Global Climate Agenda

Emissions from transport already account for 20% of the world’s GHG emissions. With the rapid pace of urbanization and motorization in developing countries, this could increase by 60% by 2050. India is currently 

The Paris Agreement aims to limit global temperature rise to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, and pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius. To achieve this, the agreement sets targets for countries to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions.

To support the transition to active mobility, ABC Bill   aims to reduce the percentage of trips made by personal motorized vehicles. Currently, in urban areas, personal motorized vehicles account for around 70% of trips. By promoting walking and cycling, India can aim to reduce the percentage of trips made by personal motorized vehicles to 50%, which would significantly reduce emissions from the transport sector.

ABC Bill embraces the Paris Climate Action Plan on reducing emissions and supports the vision of "Reduced Emission by shifting the way the people move".
