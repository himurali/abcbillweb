# Chapter 5 : Commissionerate for Active Mobility
Commissionerate for Active Mobility is a multi-disciplinary organization that is focused on creating safe, accessible, and sustainable active mobility infrastructure and environments. Its structure and key activities are designed to address the various challenges and opportunities associated with promoting active transportation, and to ensure that the needs of all users, including women and children, are considered in planning and implementation.

## Commissionerate - Systemic Structure for capacity and capability building for Active Mobility:

Here are some key elements that could be included in the Commissionerate for Active Mobility for capacity and capability building for Active Mobility:

Needs Assessment: The first step in designing a structure for capacity and capability building for Active Mobility is to conduct a needs assessment. This assessment would involve identifying the current state of Active Mobility in the country and the gaps in capacity and capability that need to be addressed.

Goals and Objectives: Based on the needs assessment, clear and specific goals and objectives for capacity and capability building for Active Mobility should be developed. These goals and objectives should be aligned with the overall objectives of the Atmanirbhar Bharath cycle bill and should focus on building the skills and knowledge required to support sustainable transportation.

Training and Education Programs: A range of training and education programs should be developed to address the identified capacity and capability gaps. These programs could include workshops, online courses, certification programs, and other forms of training.

Knowledge Sharing and Collaboration: A structure should be put in place to facilitate knowledge sharing and collaboration among stakeholders involved in Active Mobility, including government agencies, NGOs, industry partners, and other relevant groups. This could involve the creation of networks, forums, and other platforms for sharing information and best practices.

Monitoring and Evaluation: Finally, a system for monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness of the capacity and capability building structure should be established. This could involve tracking metrics such as the number of individuals trained, the effectiveness of training programs, and the impact on Active Mobility outcomes.

By implementing a structure for capacity and capability building for Active Mobility that includes these elements, the Atmanirbhar Bharath cycle bill could help to support the development of a skilled workforce and a strong knowledge base to promote sustainable transportation and support the growth of the cycling industry in India.
