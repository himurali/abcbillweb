# Chapter 7 Atmanirbhar Bharat Cycle Components
 

A MISSION to promote and implement active mobility in India on a mission mode with a focus on last mile connectivity, integration with public transport, and bicycle tourism, with a methodology for implementation and measurement of progress with feedback from citizens.

## BACKGROUND
Active mobility, which includes walking, cycling, and other non-motorized modes of transportation, is essential for sustainable and efficient urban transportation. It has the potential to reduce traffic congestion, air pollution, carbon emissions, and promote healthy lifestyles. However, the lack of proper infrastructure, safety concerns, and limited last-mile connectivity have hindered its growth in India.

To address these issues, the Government of India is launching Mission Atmanirbhar Bharat Cycle, aimed at promoting and implementing active mobility on a mission mode with a focus on last mile connectivity, integration with public transport, and bicycle tourism.

## COMPONENTS OF THE MISSION
The  Atmanirbhar Bharat Cycle Mission will focus on the following components:

The  Atmanirbhar Bharat Cycle Mission is a proposed   initiative aimed at promoting active mobility in India, which refers to non-motorized modes of transportation such as walking, cycling, and non-motorized public transport. 

The mission has five key components that need to be scaled to transition the nation into a green and healthy nation.

### Active Mobility Justice
The first component is Active Mobility Justice, which aims to ensure that active mobility is accessible and safe for all citizens, especially for those who are economically or socially disadvantaged. This can be achieved through the implementation of equitable policies and infrastructure that prioritize the needs of pedestrians, cyclists, and public transport users.
The Commissionerate  will have the mandate to ensure the Active Mobility Justice 

### Active Mobility Governance

The second component is Active Mobility Governance, which focuses on the role of local and national government in promoting active mobility. This involves developing policies and regulations that support active mobility, such as improving pedestrian and cycling infrastructure, reducing speed limits, and increasing public transport services.

The Commissionerate  will have the mandate to ensure the Active Mobility Governance Framework is established with a clear mandate to deliver active mobility. 

### Active Mobility Research

The third component is Active Mobility Research, which aims to promote evidence-based decision-making in the development of active mobility policies and infrastructure. This involves conducting research on the health, environmental, and economic benefits of active mobility, as well as studying the behavior and preferences of citizens in relation to active mobility.

The Commissionerate  will have the mandate to ensure the Active Mobility Research provides insights for enabling Active Mobility on scale.

### Active Mobility Infrastructure

The fourth component is Active Mobility Infrastructure, which involves the development of safe, convenient, and well-connected pedestrian and cycling infrastructure, as well as the expansion of non-motorized public transport services. This includes the development of cycling lanes, footpaths, pedestrian crossings, and other facilities that promote active mobility.

The Commissionerate  will have the mandate to ensure the Active Mobility Infrastructure is made available across India. 

### Active Mobility Economy and Development

The fifth component is Active Mobility Economy and Development, which focuses on the potential economic benefits of promoting active mobility, such as reducing healthcare costs and creating new jobs in the cycling and pedestrian infrastructure sector. This involves partnering with private businesses and entrepreneurs to promote sustainable modes of transportation and to build a thriving active mobility industry.

By scaling these five components of the Bharat Active Mobility Bill, India can transition into a green and healthy nation, with improved public health, reduced pollution, and a more sustainable transportation system.
The Commissionerate  will have the mandate to ensure the Active Mobility Economy receives the much needed boost in terms of subsidy, encouragement.


## CONCLUSION
The   Atmanirbhar Bharat Cycle Mission will promote active mobility and create a sustainable and efficient urban transportation system in India. It will provide last-mile connectivity, integrate with public transport, and promote bicycle tourism. The mission will be implemented through a comprehensive plan and methodology, with measurement of progress and feedback from citizens.
