# Chapter 8: Outcomes

The Active Mobility Bill in India, if implemented effectively, can have several positive outcomes on health, fossil fuel import bill, transport cost, environment conservation, and time saved by reducing congestion. Here are some potential outcomes:

Health: Active mobility, such as cycling and walking, can improve public health by reducing the prevalence of obesity, diabetes, and heart disease. By promoting active mobility, the Active Mobility Bill can contribute to improving public health in India.

Fossil Fuel Import Bill: Active mobility does not require any fuel consumption, which can lead to a reduction in the import bill for fossil fuels. This can have a significant impact on India's economy, which is heavily dependent on imported fossil fuels.

Transport Cost: Active mobility can reduce the cost of transport for individuals, as it does not require the use of fuel or the payment of tolls or parking fees. This can make transport more affordable and accessible for all sections of society.

Environment Conservation: Active mobility can reduce greenhouse gas emissions and other pollutants, contributing to environmental conservation. By promoting active mobility, the Active Mobility Bill can help in achieving India's climate goals and improving air quality.

Time Saved by Reducing Congestion: Active mobility can reduce congestion on roads, leading to time savings for commuters. This can also have a positive impact on the economy by increasing productivity and reducing travel time.

In conclusion, the Active Mobility Bill in India can have several positive outcomes on health, fossil fuel import bill, transport cost, environment conservation, and time saved by reducing congestion. However, the success of the bill depends on effective implementation and the cooperation of all stakeholders, including the government, private sector, and the public.
