# Chapter 1 : Commissionerate for Active Mobility
Commissionerate for Active Mobility is a multi-disciplinary organization that is focused on creating safe, accessible, and sustainable active mobility infrastructure and environments. Its structure and key activities are designed to address the various challenges and opportunities associated with promoting active transportation, and to ensure that the needs of all users, including women and children, are considered in planning and implementation.


The Commissionerate for Active Mobility could be an organization responsible for overseeing and coordinating the activities of the five directorates that promote active mobility in India. Its primary role would be to monitor the progress of active mobility projects and initiatives, and to commission new projects where necessary.



The Commissionerate could focus on various areas of active mobility, such as:

- Directorate of Active Mobility Justice: Role includes promoting safety, accessibility, inclusivity, and climate justice in active mobility, and ensuring equitable access to active mobility infrastructure for all citizens.

- Directorate of Active Mobility Infrastructure: Role includes   developing and maintaining infrastructure for walking, cycling, and non-motorized public transport, such as complete streets, cycle paths, and walking paths. The Directorate could also focus on promoting green urban infrastructure, reduced speeds, integrated public transit infrastructure, maintenance, and design for longevity.

- Directorate of Active Mobility Governance: Role includes Design of State & Central  Level organizations and developing and implementing policies and programs that promote active mobility, and coordinating with local and state governments to ensure a coordinated approach to active mobility.

- Directorate of Active Mobility Travel: Role  includes promoting active travel for pilgrimage, trekking, and camping, and developing and maintaining infrastructure for Active Travel activities.

- Directorate of Active Mobility Economics and Development: Role includes promoting the manufacturing of bicycles, supply chain, components, and SMEs, bicycle and parts industries, production capability, and entrepreneurship with Active Mobility startups, and bicycle logistics with cargo bicycles.



## Commissionerate - Systemic Structure for capacity and capability building for Active Mobility:

Here are some key elements that could be included in the Commissionerate for Active Mobility for capacity and capability building for Active Mobility:

Needs Assessment: The first step in designing a structure for capacity and capability building for Active Mobility is to conduct a needs assessment. This assessment would involve identifying the current state of Active Mobility in the country and the gaps in capacity and capability that need to be addressed.

Goals and Objectives: Based on the needs assessment, clear and specific goals and objectives for capacity and capability building for Active Mobility should be developed. These goals and objectives should be aligned with the overall objectives of the Atmanirbhar Bharath cycle bill and should focus on building the skills and knowledge required to support sustainable transportation.

Training and Education Programs: A range of training and education programs should be developed to address the identified capacity and capability gaps. These programs could include workshops, online courses, certification programs, and other forms of training.

Knowledge Sharing and Collaboration: A structure should be put in place to facilitate knowledge sharing and collaboration among stakeholders involved in Active Mobility, including government agencies, NGOs, industry partners, and other relevant groups. This could involve the creation of networks, forums, and other platforms for sharing information and best practices.

Monitoring and Evaluation: Finally, a system for monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness of the capacity and capability building structure should be established. This could involve tracking metrics such as the number of individuals trained, the effectiveness of training programs, and the impact on Active Mobility outcomes.

By implementing a structure for capacity and capability building for Active Mobility that includes these elements, the Atmanirbhar Bharath cycle bill could help to support the development of a skilled workforce and a strong knowledge base to promote sustainable transportation and support the growth of the cycling industry in India.
