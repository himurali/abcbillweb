# Chapter 5 : Establishment of Directorate for Active Mobility Urban Design & Infrastructure


Active Mobility Infrastructure is a critical component of promoting active mobility, which refers to non-motorized modes of transportation such as walking, cycling, and non-motorized public transport. The infrastructure should prioritize the needs of pedestrians, cyclists, and public transport users to create a safe, convenient, and well-connected system.

Safety is a crucial aspect of Active Mobility Infrastructure. The infrastructure should be designed to prioritize the safety of pedestrians and cyclists, such as the development of separate cycling lanes and pedestrian crossings. Complete streets are an essential aspect of safety, which involves designing streets that are safe for all users, including pedestrians, cyclists, and motorists.

Cycle paths and walking paths are important aspects of Active Mobility Infrastructure. These dedicated paths for pedestrians and cyclists should be separated from vehicular traffic to ensure safety and convenience. Green urban infrastructure such as parks, green spaces, and urban forests can also be incorporated to promote active mobility and enhance the urban environment.

Reduced speeds are another aspect of Active Mobility Infrastructure. Lower speed limits for motorized vehicles can help reduce the risk of accidents and create a safer environment for pedestrians and cyclists.

Integrated public transit infrastructure is also an important aspect of Active Mobility Infrastructure. This involves connecting non-motorized modes of transportation to public transit to create a seamless and convenient transportation system.

Maintenance and design for longevity are critical aspects of Active Mobility Infrastructure. Infrastructure must be designed to last and be maintained to ensure its longevity. This includes regular upkeep of cycling lanes, footpaths, and other active mobility infrastructure to ensure they remain safe and accessible for all users.

In conclusion, Active Mobility Infrastructure is a crucial component of promoting active mobility. By focusing on safety, complete streets, cycle paths and walking paths, green urban infrastructure, reduced speeds, integrated public transit infrastructure, maintenance, and design for longevity, we can create a transportation system that is sustainable, healthy, and safe for all users.


## Appointment of Director for  Active Mobility - Urban 

Developing and implementing policies, programs, and projects that promote cycling and other forms of active mobility in urban areas.

Collaborating with other government agencies, non-governmental organizations, and community groups to promote urban cycling and create safer cycling infrastructure in urban areas.

Coordinating with city planners and transportation agencies to ensure that cycling infrastructure is integrated with existing transportation systems.

Promoting the use of cycling as a sustainable and healthy mode of transportation and advocating for its benefits to the public in urban areas.

Conducting research and analysis to better understand the needs and preferences of cyclists and using this information to inform policy decisions.

Monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness of cycling programs and projects to ensure that they meet their intended goals.

### Key Activities:

* Design and implement active mobility infrastructure projects, including bike lanes, pedestrian crossings, traffic calming measures, and other interventions to make streets safer and more accessible for all users.
* Develop and implement campaigns to promote active mobility, including educational programs, social marketing campaigns, and behavior change interventions.
* Conduct road safety audits, develop road safety plans, and implement road safety interventions to reduce the number and severity of crashes involving pedestrians and cyclists.
* Create streets that are safe and accessible for women and children, including implementing measures such as traffic calming, safe crossings, and dedicated bike lanes.
* Conduct research on the impact of active mobility interventions, evaluate program effectiveness, and disseminate research findings to inform policy and practice.
* Build partnerships with government agencies, community organizations, and other stakeholders to advance the mission of the organization.
* Develop and maintain a comprehensive database of active mobility infrastructure and programs, and share best practices and lessons learned with other organizations and communities.
