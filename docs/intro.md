## ATMANIRBHAR BHARAT CYCLE BILL, 2023 
---


# Preamble:

India has witnessed rapid urbanization and motorization in the last few decades, leading to increased traffic congestion, air pollution, and adverse health impacts. There is a need to promote sustainable modes of transportation, including active mobility such as cycling and walking, to address these challenges. The Atmanirbhar Bharath Cycle Bill aims to create an ecosystem for enabling active mobility in India by providing funding, establishing a commissionerate for active mobility, and launching a mission to build the movement.


The Indian bicycle industry faces several challenges in terms of meeting the domestic demand and becoming competitive globally, especially vis-à-vis both cheaper and superior bicycles and parts from foreign producers. The Indian industry doesn’t produce medium/high-quality premium bicycles from superior materials, which are demanded in international markets. In addition, the growing domestic demand for such bicycles is increasingly met by imports and
established international brands. In order to become more competitive in domestic as well as export markets, Indian manufacturers must be able to overcome certain key technology/skill gaps, produce bicycles in line with international trends and standards, effectively market and sell bicycles in global markets and facilitate backward and forward integration within the domestic value chain.
