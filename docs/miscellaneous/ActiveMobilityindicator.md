# Opportunity for Active Mobility indicator
Definition
Infrastructure for active mobility, namely walking and cycling.

Parameter
The length of roads and streets with pavements, bike lanes, 30 km/h (20 mp/h) zones and pedestrian zones related to total length of city road network (excluding motorways).

Ram = Share of road length adapted for active mobility [n]
Lpv = Length of road network with pavements (not if in a pedestrian zone) [km]
Lbl = Length of road network with bike lanes (not if in a 30 km/h zone) [km]
Lz30 = Length of road network in 30 km/h zone [km]
Lpz = Length of pedestrian zone(s) [km]
Lrn = Total length of city road network (excluding motorways) [km]


#   Active Mobility Observatory


An active mobility observatory is a tool used by cities to collect and analyze data on various forms of sustainable transportation, such as walking, cycling, and public transit. This data can include information on the number of trips made by each mode of transportation, the length and quality of infrastructure for each mode, and safety statistics. By collecting and analyzing this data, cities can identify areas where improvements are needed, track changes in transportation patterns over time, and make data-driven decisions about how to allocate resources to support sustainable transportation.

The development and maintenance of active mobility observatories can be an important part of a city's efforts to promote sustainable transportation and reduce dependence on cars. By providing transparent and accurate information about sustainable transportation options, observatories can help to build public support for sustainable transportation initiatives, encourage more people to use active modes of transportation, and improve the safety and accessibility of infrastructure for walking, cycling, and public transit.
