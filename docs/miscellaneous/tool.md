# Bicycle Account 

 A bicycle account is a tool used by cities and municipalities to collect and publish data on cycling statistics. This data can include information on the number of cyclists, the types of cycling facilities available, the length and quality of cycling infrastructure, and safety statistics. By collecting and sharing this information, cities can track changes in cycling patterns over time, identify areas where improvements are needed, and make data-driven decisions about how to allocate resources to support cycling.
