# Active mobility infrastructure 


Here are some core components for infrastructure to enable active mobility:


## Walkways and Cycleways: 
Dedicated pathways for walking and cycling are essential to enable active mobility. These pathways should be well-maintained, well-lit, and clearly marked to ensure safety for pedestrians and cyclists.

## Intersection Design: 
Intersection design plays a critical role in ensuring safety for active mobility users. Design elements such as traffic calming measures, raised crossings, and pedestrian and cyclist priority zones should be incorporated into intersection design.

## Signaling: 
Effective signaling systems are necessary to ensure the safe and efficient movement of active mobility users. Signals should be designed to accommodate both pedestrians and cyclists, and should be well-coordinated with other modes of transportation.

## Public Transit Integration: 
Active mobility infrastructure should be integrated with public transit systems to facilitate seamless and efficient mobility. Integration should include safe and convenient access to transit stops and stations, as well as secure bike parking facilities at transit locations.

## Cutting Patterns for Highways and Rural Areas: 
Infrastructure should be designed to ensure that active mobility is accessible to all members of the community, including those in rural areas and low-income communities. Cutting patterns for highways and rural areas should be designed to enable walking and cycling, and should include appropriate safety features.

## Accessibility: 
Active mobility infrastructure should be designed to be accessible to all members of the community, including those with disabilities. This includes features such as ramps, curb cuts, and accessible pedestrian signals.

## Security: 
Adequate lighting and security measures should be incorporated into active mobility infrastructure to ensure safety for all users, particularly at night or in areas with high crime rates.

## Maintenance:
 Regular maintenance is necessary to ensure that active mobility infrastructure remains safe and functional. Infrastructure should be regularly inspected and maintained to ensure that it remains in good condition.

## Education and Outreach:
Education and outreach efforts are necessary to ensure that active mobility infrastructure is used safely and effectively. This includes efforts to promote safe behavior among users, as well as outreach to promote active mobility as a healthy and sustainable mode of transportation.
