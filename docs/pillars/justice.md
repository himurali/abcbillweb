# Active Mobility Justice

## Climate Justice:

Active mobility is a sustainable and environmentally friendly mode of transportation. As such, it is important to ensure that policies and infrastructure support active mobility as part of efforts to address climate change and promote climate justice.

## Kids' Right to Movement and Climate Justice: 
Active mobility is especially important for children, who have a right to safe and healthy movement. Policies and infrastructure should prioritize safe and accessible walking and cycling for children, including safe routes to school. Such policies also contribute to climate justice by reducing carbon emissions from transportation.

## Mobility for Women and Accessible Transport for Women:
Women are often disproportionately affected by barriers to mobility, including lack of safe and accessible transportation options. Active mobility infrastructure should be designed to prioritize the needs of women, including safe and accessible walking and cycling routes and access to public transit.

## Mobility for the Poor: 
Active mobility is an affordable mode of transportation that can be especially important for low-income communities. Policies and infrastructure should ensure that walking and cycling are safe and accessible for all members of the community, including those with limited financial resources.

## Pedestrian Deaths - AM Courts: 
Pedestrian deaths are a tragic consequence of inadequate infrastructure and unsafe behavior. AM Courts should be established to ensure that those responsible for pedestrian deaths are held accountable and that justice is served.

## Pedestrian Insurance/Cycle Insurance: 
Insurance policies should be established to protect active mobility users in the event of accidents or other incidents. Such policies should be designed to prioritize the needs of vulnerable users, such as pedestrians and cyclists.

## Community Engagement - Forum: 
Community engagement is essential to ensuring that active mobility policies and infrastructure reflect the needs and priorities of local communities. A community engagement forum should be established to provide a platform for community members to share their experiences, provide feedback, and engage in the development of active mobility policies and infrastructure.
