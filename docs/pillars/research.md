# Active Mobility Research
This brief outlines the key research and planning considerations for the development and implementation of active mobility policies and programs. It highlights the importance of conducting research on industry, design, service standards, green infrastructure and urbanism, urban planning, statistics on active mobility users, justice for vulnerable groups, and livelihood enablement. The research findings will inform evidence-based policy and program development and ensure that active mobility policies and programs are responsive to community needs and expectations.

**Research on Industry:**

Conduct research on the active mobility industry to identify emerging trends, technologies, and best practices
Use industry research findings to inform policy and program development and to support innovation and entrepreneurship in the active mobility sector
Foster collaboration and knowledge-sharing among different stakeholders, including government agencies, industry representatives, and civil society organizations, to facilitate industry research and development.

**Research on Design:**
Conduct research on active mobility design to identify best practices and design principles that prioritize safety, accessibility, and comfort for walking, cycling, and public transport
Use design research findings to inform policy and program development and to support the development of high-quality active mobility infrastructure and services
Foster collaboration and knowledge-sharing among different stakeholders, including architects, engineers, planners, and designers, to facilitate design research and development

**Research on Service Standards:**
Conduct research on active mobility service standards to identify best practices and quality indicators for walking, cycling, and public transport services
Use service standards research findings to inform policy and program development and to support the development of high-quality active mobility services and customer experiences
Foster collaboration and knowledge-sharing among different stakeholders, including service providers, customers, and industry representatives, to facilitate service standards research and development

**Research on Green Infrastructure and Urbanism:**
Conduct research on green infrastructure and urbanism to identify best practices and design principles that promote sustainable and livable urban environments
Use green infrastructure and urbanism research findings to inform policy and program development and to support the development of sustainable and environmentally friendly active mobility infrastructure and services
Foster collaboration and knowledge-sharing among different stakeholders, including urban planners, environmentalists, and community groups, to facilitate green infrastructure and urbanism research and development

**Research on Urban Planning and Active Mobility:** 
Conduct research on urban planning and active mobility to identify best practices and design principles that prioritize walking, cycling, and public transport in urban planning processes
Use urban planning and active mobility research findings to inform policy and program development and to support the development of integrated and sustainable urban transport systems
Foster collaboration and knowledge-sharing among different stakeholders, including urban planners, transport planners, and community groups, to facilitate urban planning and active mobility research and development

**Research on Statistics on Active Mobility Users:**
Conduct research on statistics on active mobility users to gather data on the demographics, behaviors, and preferences of walking, cycling, and public transport users
Use statistics research findings to inform policy and program development and to support evidence-based decision-making in the active mobility sector
Foster collaboration and knowledge-sharing among different stakeholders, including government agencies, industry representatives, and civil society organizations, to facilitate statistics research and development

**Research on Justice for Vulnerable Groups:**
Conduct research on justice for vulnerable groups, including low-income groups, people with disabilities, and marginalized communities, to identify the barriers and challenges they face in accessing active mobility infrastructure and services
Use justice research findings to inform policy and program development and to ensure that active mobility policies and programs are inclusive and equitable
Foster collaboration and knowledge-sharing among different stakeholders, including community groups, social welfare organizations, and government agencies, to facilitate justice research and development
