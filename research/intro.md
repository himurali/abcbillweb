# Active Mobility Research
Active mobility, which refers to human-powered transportation such as walking, cycling, or wheeling, is increasingly recognized as a means to address various dimensions of societal challenges such as climate change, health, equity, women mobility, and kids' mobility. 

In this section we find the research papers  on each of these perspectives:


 
*  Climate change: Active mobility is an essential part of sustainable transportation, as it reduces greenhouse gas emissions and reduces dependence on fossil fuels. Studies have shown that a shift towards active mobility can result in significant reductions in carbon emissions and other air pollutants.
 
*   Health: Active mobility is associated with numerous health benefits, such as reducing the risk of chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease, obesity, and diabetes. Additionally, active transportation can improve mental health by reducing stress, anxiety, and depression.
 
*   Economics & Equity: Active mobility can provide transportation options for individuals who may not have access to a car or public transit, such as low-income or marginalized populations. By making streets and sidewalks safe and accessible for pedestrians and cyclists, active mobility can help promote transportation equity.
 
*   Women mobility: Women often face unique challenges when it comes to mobility, such as safety concerns and caregiver responsibilities. Active mobility can offer a safe and affordable transportation option for women, especially in areas with limited public transit options.
 
*  Kids mobility: Active mobility can promote physical activity among children and help improve their health. Additionally, walking or cycling to school can enhance social connections among children and their communities, and provide them with an opportunity to learn valuable life skills such as road safety.
